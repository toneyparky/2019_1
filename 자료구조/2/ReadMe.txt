Good day professor.

This is Seungwan Park from Data structure lecture.

I just found a function that convert from .ipynb to .py in a jupiter notebook.

But I can not make sure these .py files are working well or not.

If is not working please check .ipynb files later or contact me Prof :)

Thanks for your helpful lecture!
